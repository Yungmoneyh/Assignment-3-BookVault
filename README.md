# BookVault

BookVault is a web application built for INFR3120 Assignment 3.  
It allows users to securely track and share their reading, manage their personal book collection, and view books added by other users.

## Project Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, login, and logout securely. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
- **CRUD Functionality**: Users can create, read, update, and delete their own books.
- **Public Books Page**: All books added by any user are displayed on the public page.
- **Responsive UI**: Custom CSS with gradients and glass-like panels, combined with Bootstrap, for a modern and clean design.
- **Secure Sessions**: Express-session with MongoDB store ensures sessions are safe and persistent.

## How It Works

1. Users can sign up with a unique username, email, and password.
2. Logged-in users can add books by entering the title and author.
3. Books added by a user appear on their "My Books" page, where they can edit or delete them.
4. All books are visible on the "Public Books" page, making it easy for other users to browse shared reading lists.

## Project Plan

BookVault aims to make book tracking simple and interactive and all users can manage their reading privately while having access to a public library. The design uses a visually appealing gradient theme and cards for books, making it engaging and easy to navigate.
